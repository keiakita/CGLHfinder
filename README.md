# 1.The digitalized text
A line-by-line transcription of Spinoza's "Compendium Grammatices Linguae Hebraeae" itself.
It is based on the edition by Carl Gebhardt (1925).

# 2. Critical footnotes
Mainly showing differences between editions.

# 3. MoveTo Mode
Choose any Chapter from the Drop-Down list and click "MovoTo" button to move to the (head of the) Chapter.
"(Search Result)" option is available when you use #4 Search Mode.

# 4. Search Mode
It provides the full-text searching with regular expression.
Each result shall be listed (if any) with its location as "CC-PPP-LL" (Cap.CC, p.PPP, l.LL).

Be noted that some of auxiliary symbols are ignored in default mode.
e.g. you can search "praecipué" with query like "praecipue" (without the accent grave).

The removed characters are defined as Unicode region(s) shown below.
Note that Hebrew vocalization and cantilation symbols shall be ignored in searching.
e.g. You can find "מֶלֶךְ" with query like "מלך".
Whenever such removal (i.e. normalization) is done, the line will be marked with "normalized" notation.

var diacriticsRemover = /([̀-̈]|[֑-ׇ]|[᾽-῀`´῾])/g;

It might be improved or discarded.
